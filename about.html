  <p>Hello my name is Ethan Hageman</p>
  <p>I grew up in rural Kansas, living and working in the agriculture space</p>
  <p>I got the computer bug at a young age when building PC rigs together with my dad</p>
  <p>I also gained a passion for the workings of the business world from my Grandma who pushed me to learn</p>
  <p>more about the economic world we live in and pursue the entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
  <p>I was homeschooled thoughout most of my primary education until my first year studying business science at <span class="blue"> Barton County Community college</span></p>
  <p>I graduated with an associates in 2023 and am now pursing an integrated computer science degree at <span class="purple"> K-state </span>.</p>
  <p>Outside of school work, I really enjoy playing video games, playing music, animal photography, digital art and building things (anything from computers, to small engines, to tiny whittled statues).</p>
